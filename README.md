### A Julia wrapper for the graph isomorphism tool nauty

This wrapper implements the nauty graph datastructure and makes it compatible with the Julia Graphs ecosystem. This combines the convenience of Julia Graphs with the efficiency of the nauty isomorphism algorithm. Graphs can be canonically labeled and checked for isomorphism.
