# Graph automorphism groups
To obtain information about a graph's automorphism group, use `nauty(g)`. This will return the canonical permutation as well as an `AutomorphismGroup` object.
Right now, the recorded properties of the automorphism group are very limited and only include the group size and orbits, but this will change in the future.
